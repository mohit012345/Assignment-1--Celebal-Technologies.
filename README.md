 # If-Else Task – Internship Assignment

 📝 Task Overview

This task is part of an internship assignment provided by the company. The objective is to implement and demonstrate the use of basic conditional logic using `if-else` statements in Python. The program is designed to take user input and execute different code blocks based on the conditions defined.

## 📌 Problem Statement

**(Customize this section as per your specific task)**

Write a Python program that:

* Takes an integer input from the user.
* Checks if the number is:

  * Positive
  * Negative
  * Zero
* Based on the condition, print the appropriate message.

🧠 Logic Used

The task uses simple `if-elif-else` statements to:

* Compare the input value.
* Determine which condition it satisfies.
* Print a relevant output based on the result.

💡 Sample Code

```python
# Program to check if the number is positive, negative or zero

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if num > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif num < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
else:
    print("The number is zero.")
```
🧪 Sample Output

```
Input: -5
Output: The number is negative.
```

```
Input: 0
Output: The number is zero.
```

```
Input: 10
Output: The number is positive.
```

## 📂 File Structure

```

└── README.md       # Project description and documentation
```

## ✅ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.
2. Run the file using a Python interpreter:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input a number.
